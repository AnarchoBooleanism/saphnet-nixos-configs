# Find way to copy over ssh keys to a temp root directory, probably delete the temp directory first if possible too
# Then, use those SSH keys to create age key
# Then use nixos-anywhere with everything, make sure everything is set up right, also try to find way to skip SSH passphrase repeating (use keychain?)
